# Ultimate_Java_part1_Fundamentals
I learned the following concepts:
# 1. Types (Summarised belowed)

* Variables and constants

* Primitive and Reference Types

* Casting

* Numbers, Strings, and Arrays

* Read Input
# Solve The Challenge: Mortgage Calculator

Principal : 

Annual Interest Rate: 

Period (Years):

Mortgage: $

Hints: Visit wikiHow.com: Calculating Mortgage Payments with an Equation

This program has a number of problems to be solved

- input validation

# 2. Control flow 
* Comparison Operators
* Logical Operators
* Conditional Statements
* Loops

I have created a branch call control_flow to solve the input validation problem
# 3. Clean coding
I have created a branch call clean_coding to refactor the control_flow branch to make it more cleaner 
# 4. Finding and fixing errors
* Types of errors
* Common errors
* Debugging
* Packaging
# Programming Paradigms
* Procedural
* Funtional (Important!)
* Object-Oriented (I used this paradigm to improved on my Mortgage calculator project)(Important!)
* Event-driven
* Logic
* Aspect-oriented
# Benefits of Object-oriented Programming
* Reduced Complexity
* Easier Maintenance
* Code Resuse
* Faster Development
# Classes and Objects
* Class: A blueprint for creating objects
* Object: An instance of a class
